          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            In a world of mass production, we celebrate the slow, intentional, and imperfect beauty of handcrafted goods. <strong>Earthen Collective</strong> was born from a desire to connect people with functional art that carries a human touch. We believe the objects we bring into our homes should have a soul and a story.

          <h2>The Collective</h2>
          <p>
            We are not just a store; we are a curated collection of works from passionate artisans. Our "collective" brings together talented potters and ceramicists, giving them a platform to share their craft. When you purchase from us, you're not just buying a pot—you're supporting an artist's dream and preserving the timeless tradition of handmade pottery.

          <h2>Our Journey</h2>
          <p>
            It began in 2024 with a simple observation: the most cherished items are those with a story. We started by visiting small, local studios in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, discovering incredible talent hidden in plain sight. What started as a small online gallery quickly grew into a vibrant collective, a space where the timeless art of pottery meets the modern connoisseur.
